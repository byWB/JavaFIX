Bitcoin


 - each user has a private + public key combination (their wallet), and can create an address.
 
 - Users trade their coins using the private/public key combination, central FIX verifies the transactions.
 
 - I use my private key to sign and you dissemble with my public key - my private key is secret and complicated and so no one can fake messages from me.
